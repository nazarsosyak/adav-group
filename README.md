## **Who Infected the Market?**

**Ever wondered which stock took your wallet down the drain?**  
**Looking for someone to blame for your life savings disappearing?**

We can help with that.

### **The idea**

Markets don’t collapse all at once.  
They spread.

A sudden price shock rarely stays local. It travels through correlations, sector linkages, and hidden dependencies, infecting stocks that were never directly exposed to the original event.

This project treats financial markets as a **living system**, where shocks behave like pathogens and risk propagates through a complex network.

### **Research questions**

This investigation is guided the following research questions:

> **How do market shocks propagate?**
Through which channels do shocks spread, and how do individual stocks and sectors react as the disturbance unfolds?
> **Can we identify a patient zero?**
Is it possible to trace major market events back to an initial source, and distinguish between early carriers, super-spreaders, and secondary infections?
> **What are the dynamics of financial contagion?**
How fast does risk propagate, how concentrated is the spread, and when does it become systemic?
> **Does the market have an immune system?**
How does the market absorb, dampen or amplify shocks, and under what conditions does this defense mechanism fail?

### **Our objective**

> **Find the patient zero.  
> Identify the spreading patterns.  
> Reconstruct the outbreak.  
> Then politely ask the culprit to explain themselves in court.**

### **How it works**

Using a large stock-level dataset, we reconstruct financial outbreaks step by step.  
Each post in this blog is a **case file**, documenting:

- early warning signals  
- transmission paths across stocks and sectors  
- super-spreader behavior  
- moments where the market’s immune system failed  

The goal is not prediction, but **forensic understanding**.

### **The investigation workflow**

This investigation is staged like a real outbreak response:

1. **Market segmentation**  
   We first scan the full timeline to detect **critical periods** where an outbreak is suspected.

2. **Zoom-in on a selected outbreak window**  
   Once a period is flagged, we isolate it and treat it as a **contained outbreak**.

3. **Network analysis**  
   Inside the outbreak window, we build a network of interactions to identify:
   - probable patient zero 
   - super-spreaders 
   - propagation paths

4. **Sector analysis**  
   Finally, we map the outbreak onto sectors to detect:
   - critical sectors that amplify contagion  
   - sector-to-sector transmission patterns  
   - whether the outbreak is localized or system-wide

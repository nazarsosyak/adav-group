# Who Infected the Market?

Markets do not collapse all at once.  
They spread.

A sudden price shock rarely stays local. It travels through correlations, sector linkages, and hidden dependencies, infecting stocks that were never directly exposed to the original event.

This project treats the stock market as a **living system**.

Some stocks show symptoms early.  
Some amplify the shock.  
Others silently transmit risk across the network.

Our objective is simple:

> **Find the patient zero.  
> Identify the spreading patterns.  
> Reconstruct the outbreak.
> Politely ask the culprit to explain themselves in court. **

Using a large stock-level dataset, we reconstruct the outbreak step by step. Each post in this blog is a **case file**: documenting signals, transmission paths, and moments where the market’s immune system failed.

Welcome to the investigation.

## Who Infected the Market?

**Ever wondered which stock took your wallet down the drain?**  
**Looking for someone to blame for your life savings disappearing?**

We can help with that.

### The idea

Markets don’t collapse all at once.  
They spread.

A sudden price shock rarely stays local. It travels through correlations, sector linkages, and hidden dependencies, infecting stocks that were never directly exposed to the original event.

This project treats financial markets as a **living system**, where shocks behave like pathogens and risk propagates through a complex network.

### Our objective

> **Find the patient zero.  
> Identify the spreading patterns.  
> Reconstruct the outbreak.  
> Then politely ask the culprit to explain themselves in court.**

### How it works

Using a large stock-level dataset, we reconstruct financial outbreaks step by step.  
Each post in this blog is a **case file**, documenting:

- early warning signals  
- transmission paths across stocks and sectors  
- super-spreader behavior  
- moments where the market’s immune system failed  

The goal is not prediction, but **forensic understanding**.

### The investigation workflow

This investigation is deliberately staged — like a real outbreak response:

1. **Market segmentation**  
   We first scan the full timeline to detect **critical periods** where an outbreak is suspected.

2. **Zoom-in on a selected outbreak window**  
   Once a period is flagged, we isolate it and treat it as a **contained outbreak**.

3. **Network analysis**  
   Inside the outbreak window, we build a network of interactions to identify:
   - probable patient zero 
   - super-spreaders 
   - propagation paths

4. **Sector analysis**  
   Finally, we map the outbreak onto sectors to detect:
   - critical sectors that amplify contagion  
   - sector-to-sector transmission patterns  
   - whether the outbreak is localized or system-wide

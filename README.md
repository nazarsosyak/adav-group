## Who Infected the Market?

**Ever wondered which stock took your wallet down the drain?**  
**Looking for someone to blame for your life savings disappearing?**

We can help with that.

### The idea

Markets don’t collapse all at once.  
They spread.

A sudden price shock rarely stays local. It travels through correlations, sector linkages, and hidden dependencies — infecting stocks that were never directly exposed to the original event.

This project treats financial markets as a **living system**, where shocks behave like pathogens and risk propagates through a complex network.

### Our objective

> **Find the patient zero.  
> Identify the spreading patterns.  
> Reconstruct the outbreak —  
> then politely ask the culprit to explain themselves in court.**

### How it works

Using a large stock-level dataset, we reconstruct financial outbreaks step by step.  
Each post in this blog is a **case file**, documenting:

- early warning signals  
- transmission paths across stocks and sectors  
- super-spreader behavior  
- moments where the market’s immune system failed  

The goal is not prediction, but **forensic understanding**.

### The investigation

This site is structured as an ongoing investigation.  
Posts follow the logic of an epidemiological inquiry:

- **Symptoms** — volatility spikes and abnormal correlations  
- **Transmission** — how shocks spread through the network  
- **Case Zero** — identifying the first infected stock  
- **Verdict** — assessing responsibility and systemic impact

**Welcome to the investigation.**
